Hello, my name is Sam Minard and I am a Social and Behavioral Sciences major and Statistics minor at California State University, Monterey Bay. I aim to earn a PhD in Sociology and conduct research at the intersection of climate change adaptation and inequality. In my free time I enjoy photography, bird watching, crocheting, and hanging out my cat.
